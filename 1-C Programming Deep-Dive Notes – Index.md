This collection of markdown files is a **complete, deep technical walkthrough of C programming**, built to support:

- Exam preparation
    
- Long-term reference
    
- Systems-level understanding
    
- Reading and writing real-world C code
    

The notes are heavily inspired by:

- Your **C-Code repository**
    
- Typical IMPR / introductory systems programming curricula
    
- Concepts aligned with _Hanly & Koffman – Problem Solving and Program Design in C_
    

These files are written to answer not just **how**, but **why** C behaves the way it does.

## 🔗 Topic Index (Deep-Dive Files)

### 🧱 Core Language Foundations

- **`data_types.md`**  
    Sizes, signed vs unsigned, integer overflow, floating-point precision, memory layout
    
- **`variables_and_scope.md`**  
    Lifetime, visibility, stack behavior, shadowing, global vs local
    
- **`operators_and_expressions.md`**  
    Arithmetic, logical, bitwise, precedence, side effects
    

---

### 🔁 Control & Program Flow

- **`control_flow.md`**  
    if/else, switch, loops, break/continue, common logic mistakes
    

---

### 📦 Arrays & Strings

    1D and 2D arrays, memory layout, bounds, array decay
    
- **`strings.md`**  
    C strings, null-termination, `string.h`, pitfalls, manual parsing
    

---

### 🔧 Functions & Modularity

- **`functions.md`**  
    Parameters, return values, stack frames, pass-by-value vs reference
    

---

### 👉 Pointers & Memory

- **`pointers.md`**  
    Addresses, dereferencing, pointer arithmetic, const correctness
    
- **`dynamic_memory.md`**  
    malloc/calloc/free, ownership, lifetime, memory leaks
    

---

### 🧩 Structured Data

- **`structs_and_typedef.md`**  
    Struct layout, padding, arrays of structs, typedef usage
    

---

### 📂 File Handling

- **`file_io.md`**  
    Reading/writing files, parsing input, error handling
    

---

### ⚠️ Debugging & Pitfalls

- **`common_errors.md`**  
    Real mistakes: segmentation faults, UB, memory misuse
    

---

### 🧠 Conceptual Mastery

- **`mental_model_of_c.md`**  
    How the compiler thinks, how memory is laid out, how to reason in C

## 🎯 How to Use These Notes

- Read alongside your **own code**
    
- Cross-reference with `main.c`
    
- Rewrite examples by hand
    
- Use as a checklist before exams
    

> If you can explain every file in this index **without looking**, you truly understand C.

## 🚀 Next Files to Be Generated

The next deep-dive files will start with:

1. `data_types.md`
    
2. `arrays.md`
    
3. `strings.md`
    
4. `pointers.md`
    

Each will be **long, detailed, and example-heavy**.
